The Activity Rings in iShnak iOS provide a clear, visual representation of user progress toward daily health goals. Each ring corresponds to a specific category—Water, Beverage, Meals, and Snacks—and dynamically fills based on tracked input. The circular design makes it easy to grasp how close a user is to reaching their goal at a glance. Each ring is color-coded for quick identification and includes a central icon that represents its category. Users can tap into individual rings to log entries, while animations and completion highlights offer positive reinforcement. This design encourages consistency, engagement, and mindful consumption throughout the day.

## Summary View

The Weekly View offers users a scrollable list of past consumption data, organized by day. Each day is displayed as a tappable card that shows a summary of water, beverage, meal, and snack intake. When selected, the card navigates to a detailed chart view for that day, providing insights through visual breakdowns of hydration and calorie sources. This structure helps users reflect on trends, identify patterns, and stay accountable to their goals over time. By combining intuitive navigation with meaningful data visualization, the Weekly View enhances the app’s focus on long-term health tracking and personal progress.

## Profile View

The Profile View empowers users to personalize their experience by managing their health goals and notification preferences. From this screen, users can set daily targets for water, beverages, meals, snacks, and calories using intuitive pickers. Additionally, they can schedule meal reminders—such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner —along with hourly water intake alerts. Toggling notifications on or off is straightforward, and visual feedback confirms each change. This view also supports real-time editing of default values, ensuring that the app adapts to evolving habits. The Profile View is essential for tailoring iShnak iOS to each user’s lifestyle and promoting consistent wellness routines.
